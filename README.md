# my_expenses_app_demo

First big app build in Flutter. This is a follow along project with Acdemind.

I started learning Flutter in 2019, but I took a break from learning Dart/Flutter to focus on really understanding JavaScript first, since I invested so much into it already. So after a few projects learning how microservices work, what microfrontends are, and how to build a full-stack apps in JS (React/React-Native/TypeScript/Node/Next/MongoDB/Firebase) -- 

#### TLDR;

I've decided to revisit Flutter to compare it to building projects in React-Native.
